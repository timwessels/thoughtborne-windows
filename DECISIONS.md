# Decisions

A short log of deliberate, non-obvious product decisions — the kind that are easy
to "fix" straight into a regression later. Each entry says what was decided, why,
and what *not* to do, so a future change meets the reasoning at the point of edit
instead of re-deriving it.

**How to use.** Read this before discussing or specifying any behavior change —
issue text included. An issue that touches a recorded decision cites it
("respects D-001" or "proposes superseding D-001"). Superseding an entry needs
the maintainer's okay; when it happens, mark the old entry "Superseded by D-NNN"
rather than deleting it. Keep this file small — only genuinely contestable calls
belong here, not every design detail.

## D-001 — Untranscribed-recording recovery: remind once, keep it retryable

Decided 2026-07-18 (#134, #133).

A recording that was saved but never successfully transcribed — a clean-exit
salvage, an in-session failure, a hard-kill recovery, or a device-loss salvage —
is offered for retry via `Ctrl+Alt+R`. That offer behaves deliberately as
follows:

- **Announce once.** The RECOVERED panel appears on the *first* start after the
  failure, then never again for that recording. Later starts still arm the
  `Ctrl+Alt+R` slot from the persistent marker, silently. Declining to recover is
  a valid choice; the tool must not nag.
- **Persistent, single slot.** Exactly the *newest* untranscribed recording is
  retryable, and it stays retryable across any number of restarts until it is
  retried successfully or a newer failure supersedes it (persistence is #114,
  single-slot is #24/#114). A new failure — including a failed retry that hits a
  transport/API error — resets the announcement to one more panel.
- **Singular wording.** The panel always says "a recording was …", never a count,
  even when several markers exist internally (#126).
- **Audio is never deleted.** Every recording stays in `history/audio/` whatever
  the marker state, so it can always be transcribed by hand.
- **Empty is a final verdict — where it can be told apart.** On the Soniox Live
  path, whose fallback chain reports whether any stage errored, an empty
  transcript from an all-clean run means the recording holds no speech and a
  retry cannot help: the marker is deleted, the audio kept, and the console says
  so honestly ("no speech found …") instead of a generic FAILED + retry hint
  (#133). A transport/API failure is the opposite — the marker is kept and stays
  retryable; and a file-based engine (the Soniox upload or a Groq slot, via
  `Ctrl+Alt+L`), which swallows transport errors and returns empty either way,
  stays on that cautious retryable side too, since its silence and its outage are
  indistinguishable. The same honest verdict applies on the in-session attempt on
  that path, so a genuinely silent dictation on Soniox Live writes no marker in
  the first place.
- **Deliberately simple.** One "announced" bit per marker (carried in the marker
  name as a `_seen` token), no count, no multi-recording bookkeeping, no states
  beyond that. Keeping this lean is the feature, per VISION.md principle #1
  (stability).

Do not reintroduce: a per-start nag, a pending count in the panel, a
consume-on-read marker (breaks cross-restart retry), or any automatic deletion of
recovered audio.
